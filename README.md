AI-Powered News Trend Aggregation and Summarization Pipeline
Overview
This project focuses on building an AI-powered pipeline that aggregates, processes, and summarizes real-time news trends. The system is built using a multithreaded, distributed architecture to efficiently scrape news data, preprocess it, and highlight key trends. The project demonstrates expertise in web scraping, distributed systems, data transformation, and batch machine learning clustering, while leveraging technologies such as Kafka, PostgreSQL, and Java multithreading.

Key Features
1. Multithreaded Web Scraper
Architecture: Designed using a manager-worker event-driven architecture for scalability.
Functionality: The web scraper extracts real-time news data from multiple sources. The manager distributes tasks to worker threads to ensure efficient data collection across the web.
2. Data Transformation and Preprocessing
Data Transfer: Scraped data is batched and sent to a PostgreSQL database.
Multithreaded Java Application: A custom-built Java application is triggered to preprocess the news data in parallel, ensuring fast and efficient handling of large datasets.
Kafka Integration: Preprocessed data is ingested into a Kafka pipeline, enabling real-time streaming of the news data for further analysis.
3. Machine Learning Clustering
Batch Processing: The pipeline data is processed using a batch clustering machine learning algorithm that identifies and groups relevant news trends.
Trend Highlighting: Key insights and trends are extracted and displayed on an intuitive frontend, offering users a clear summary of current events.
Technologies Used
Java (Multithreading): Built a robust backend system to handle concurrent processing and task distribution.
PostgreSQL: Managed data persistence, ensuring consistent and accurate storage of batched news data.
Kafka: Implemented a scalable pipeline for streaming data, enabling real-time trend analysis.
Machine Learning (Clustering): Applied a batch clustering algorithm to highlight significant news trends from the aggregated data.
Frontend Development: Designed a user-friendly interface to display summarized news trends in an appealing and digestible format.
Concepts and Skills Learned
Distributed Systems & Multithreading: Implemented manager-worker architecture to efficiently scrape and process real-time data.
Event-Driven Architecture: Developed an event-driven system using Kafka for seamless data ingestion and pipeline management.
Data Pipeline Development: Gained hands-on experience in building and managing a streaming data pipeline from web scraping to machine learning-driven trend aggregation.
Machine Learning Clustering: Learned to integrate batch clustering algorithms to automatically detect and highlight relevant trends.
Conclusion
This project showcases advanced skills in distributed systems, multithreading, data pipeline development, and machine learning. By combining real-time web scraping, data processing, and trend aggregation, it delivers a powerful solution for tracking and summarizing news trends.
